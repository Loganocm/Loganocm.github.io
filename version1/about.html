									<p>Hi, I'm Logan Miller and I appreciate you taking the time to learn a bit more about me. I live in Henrico, Virginia and I am on my journey to becoming a great Software Engineer! It is a huge world out there and there is a lot to learn about programming today. To me, that is what makes this field exciting. </p>
									<p>I started coding in middle school. For an english project, we were tasked on learning a skill and showing it off to the class, so I learned how to code in html and made a simple website. It was nothing impressive, just a bunch of headers and paragraphs. However it sparked the of joy for coding in my mind which still exists today. Seeing the work that I knew how to do pop up on the screen filled me with a sense of fufillment which was unique from anything else that I have experienced. This has motivated me to continue on my journey and develop my technical skills.</p>
									<p>Now, I am finishing my Associates Degree in Computer Science at J. Sargeant Reynolds. I will be transferring this fall to finish my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. Through my current enrollment, I have earned honors such as the dean's list and acceptance to Phi Theta Kappa. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Reynolds. I have never met someone who wasn't friendly or willing to talk about class or the passions they have outside of school. The teaching staff has been dedicated and thorough to making sure each student learns at their best.</p>

									<h2>My Research</h2>
									<p>During my time as a research assistant at VCU, I helped to aid research on Bacteriophages. I collaborated in a group of undergraduate students under Graduate Program Director Allison Johnson. </p>
									<p>Bacteriophages are viruses which uniquely affect bacteria. During this position, I learned about commonly used bioinformatics tools such as BLASTp and Phamerator along with foundational ideas relating to phage genes. I used these skills to analyze genes from various phages and annotate their functions. The goal of this position was to learn more about phages recently discovered by VCU. I carried out annotation for a phage YungSlug, newly discovered in 2020. I learned about how bioinformatical data was stored and handled in these programs and used this knowledge to aid our research.</p>
									<p>We had a question: How similar is YungSlug to other phages? Our tools allowed us to download the full genome from a vast amount of pre-sequenced examples. This allowed me to create a tool in java which compared the genetic similarity between phages. Adhering to the position of genes in the DNA, the program compared groups of nucleotides known as phams in order to develop a similarity score. Along with additional research from the group and Program Director, this supported the conclusion that YungSlug was a genetic outlier from all phages we had sequenced before. This research was collected and presented in the VCU UROP Poster Symposium.</p>

									<h2>My Interests</h2>
									<p>Outside of programming, here are some things that I like doing in my spare time.</p>
									<h4>Travelling</h4>
									<p>Travelling is a huge passion of mine. I enjoy seeing the art and architecture left behind for current generations to enjoy. Recently, I have been on trips to Sarasota, FL where I saw the Ringling Estate and all of the art that John Ringling had collected during his life. The picture at the top of the page comes from the Ringling Mansion, showcasing the level of decor that the whole estate has. The surrounding art gallary has pieces of art ranging from modern to rennaissance and ancient and is a remarkable display of the evolution of art through time. </p>
									<h4>Biking</h4>
									<p>I love biking. I have grown up going on trails with my grandfather and its one of the best ways I know to ease my stress. I love riding on the Capital Trail in Richmond and admiring what the city has to offer. It's a good way to stay in shape and I love the feeling of being out in nature.</p>
									<h4>Games</h4>
									<p>I have a strong passion for games and I have been playing them all of my life. Having a skill that you can work to improve each day is facinating. My favorite games are Chess, League of Legends and Osu!. I love Chess because it excercises my mind to explore possibilities. Each move has its own negatives and positives and it is up to you to determine what is best. Similarly, I like League of Legends because there is a highly delicate balancing act that takes skill and active effort to perform. My favorite game would be Osu!, a high pace rhythm game focused on reaction time and ability. I am currently a high rank in this game, at top 500 in the US currently. I have competed in global and local tournaments with the best players the game has to offer and it has taught me about the importance of a strong mind, dedication, and preparation.</p>
									<h4>Basketball</h4>
									<p>I am a HUGE basketball fan! I was introduced to the game through watching LeBron James at his best and it has been love at first sight. Learning about all time greats like Kobe Bryant, Shaq, and Michael Jordan has captivated me since I was young. There have been so many amazing stories and great performances and I'm blessed to have been able to watch some of them play out in front of my eyes. My favorite team is the San Antonio Spurs but I also like watching the LA Lakers, Boston Celtics, Philly 76ers, and the Miami Heat.</p>
